Good things to run:

python Quadratic.py Inf 1 1 1 1

this one does some cool fadey stuff

python CrazyColor.py Inf

this one does flashing colors

python TwinklePlusPlus.py Inf 10 100 0.5 0 0.8

Does a nice purple random-twinkle pattern.
0.5 0 0.8 are the RGB values for color

python RollerCoaster.py Inf

this does a white-light chase pattern down the length of the chain.
